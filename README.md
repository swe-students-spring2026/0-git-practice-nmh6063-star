# The Impact of AI on the Job Market
The article that will be discussed is: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-impact-on-job-market

## What is Discussed / What do I Think?
The article talks about how AI is impacting the job market. More specifically, it is discussed how those who normally would be taken entry level positions are having their jobs taken by AI, as AI is able to do those meanial tasks normally dished out to those who are just entering the Job Market. As such, the bar for entry continuously gets raised, making it more difficult for those just entering the SWE industry to get a job. I can personally relate to this feeling as I have lost count of the number of internships I have applied to, only to either get left on read or rejected. Whether or not people believe that AI actually has a positive impact, there is no denying that companies are trying to shift their goals to replace as much of their workforce as possible with AI to cut costs and "improve efficiency".

# Comment
I can agree that the rise of AI has been increasingly replacing early-career workers. This trend is concerning, not only for me, as an aspiring software engineer, but also for the future of software in general. The increase of dependence on AI for programming can lead to an increase of poorly written, less efficient, and hardly to maintain code, which could end up actually slowing down the evolution of software in the long run.
